# MarsRover

## Brief Explanation:
This is an Console Aplication made in C# .Net Core 3.1. In first place I saw that I can abstract two objects (Rover and plateau) because the Rovers has behaviours (rotate to left, rotate to right and move forward) and plateau has the size of the grid. In this example, I am assuming that the Rovers cant go out to the plateau. if the next Rover's move is out of the plateau the program will send a message, and the Rover wont move anymore.

## Instructions:
### 1.- You must to take the .txt file named "RoverCommands" and put it in "C:\" directory.
### 2.- Write the input in the RoverCommands.txt.
### 3.- Execute the Console Aplication "MarsRovers".
